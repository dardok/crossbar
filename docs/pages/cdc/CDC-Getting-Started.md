# Getting Started with CDC

## Quick Outline

Starting out with Crossbar.io DevOps Center (CDC) is quick. This is how it will work (see private alpha access below)

1. Register as a new user at CDC
2. Create a new management realm owner by you
3. Initialize and pair one or more Crossbar.io nodes with your management realm

Now you can manage your Crossbar.io nodes dynamically and remotely via a standard WAMP API from custom apps and tools. Live, securely and from anywhere.

## Private Alpha Access

Crossbar.io DevOps Center is currently in **private alpha**. If you would like to get a private alpha invitation to test CDC in a early stage, please contact us at **support at crossbario dot com**.
